Summary
Background In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent 
were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, 
provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV 
infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human 
transmission has been confirmed.
Methods We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from 
nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV 
genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to 
obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. 
Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the 
evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely 
receptor-binding properties of the virus.
Findings The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting 
more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected 
in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, 
with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically 
distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding 
domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.
Interpretation 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting 
betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an 
animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the 
virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-
converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent 
investigation.

Introduction
Viruses of the family Coronaviridae possess a single-
strand, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 
26 to 32 kilobases in length.1 Coronaviruses have been 
identified in several avian hosts,2,3 as well as in various 
mammals, including camels, bats, masked palm civets, 
mice, dogs, and cats. Novel mammalian coronaviruses 
are now regularly identified.1 For example, an HKU2-
related coronavirus of bat origin was responsible for a 
fatal acute diarrhoea syndrome in pigs in 2018.4
Among the several coronaviruses that are pathogenic 
to humans, most are associated with mild clinical 
symptoms,1 with two notable exceptions: severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a 
novel betacoronavirus that emerged in Guangdong, 
southern China, in November, 2002,5 and resulted in 
more than 8000 human infections and 774 deaths in 
37 countries during 2002–03;6 and Middle East respiratory 
syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was 
first detected in Saudi Arabia in 20127 and was responsible

for 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and 
858 fatalities since September, 2012, including 38 deaths 
following a single introduction into South Korea.8,9
In late December, 2019, several patients with viral 
pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associ­
ated with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, in the 
Hubei province of China, where a number of non-aquatic 
animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale 
before the outbreak. A novel, human-infecting corona­
virus,10,11 provisionally named 2019 novel corona­virus 
(2019-nCoV), was identified with use of next-generation 
sequencing. As of Jan 28, 2020, China has reported more 
than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected 
cases of 2019-nCoV infection across 33 Chinese prov­
inces or municipalities, with 106 fatalities. In addition, 
2019-nCoV has now been reported in Thailand, Japan, 
South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and the USA. Infec­
tions in medical workers and family clusters were also 
reported and human-to-human transmission has been 
confirmed.12 Most of the infected patients had a high 
fever and some had dyspnoea, with chest radiographs 
revealing invasive lesions in both lungs.12,13
We report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients, 
from at least three hospitals in Wuhan, who were 
diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause. 
Using next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from these 
patients, 2019-nCoV was found. We describe the genomic 
characterisation of ten genomes of this novel virus, 
providing important information on the origins and cell 
receptor binding of the virus.
Methods
Patients and samples
Nine patients with viral pneumonia and negative for 
common respiratory pathogens, who presented to at least 
three hospitals in Wuhan, were included in this study. 
Eight of the patients had visited the Huanan seafood 
market before the onset of illness, and one patient 
(WH04) did not visit the market but stayed in a hotel near 
the market between Dec 23 and Dec 27, 2019 (table). 
Five of the patients (WH19001, WH19002, WH19004, 
WH19008, and YS8011) had samples collected by the 
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) which were tested for 18 viruses and four bac­
teria using the RespiFinderSmart22 Kit (PathoFinder, 
Maastricht, Netherlands) on the LightCycler 480 Real-
Time PCR system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). 
Presence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was tested using 
a previously reported method.14 All five CDC samples 
were negative for all common respiratory pathogens 
screened for. Four of the patients (WH01, WH02, WH03, 
and WH04) had samples collected by BGI (Beijing, 
China), and were tested for five viruses and one bacterium 
using the RespiPathogen 6 Kit (Jiangsu Macro & Micro 
Test, Nantong, China) on the Applied Biosystems ABI 
7500 Real-Time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific, 
Foster City, CA, USA). All four samples were negative for 
the targeted respiratory pathogens.
Virus isolation
Special-pathogen-free human airway epithelial (HAE) 
cells were used for virus isolation. Briefly, bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluids or throat swabs from the patients were 
inoculated into the HAE cells through the apical surfaces. 
HAE cells were maintained in an air–liquid interface 
incubated at 37°C. The cells were monitored daily for 
cytopathic effects by light microscopy and the cell 
supernatants were collected for use in quantitative 
RT-PCR assays. After three passages, apical samples 
were collected for sequencing.
BGI sequencing strategy
All collected samples were sent to BGI for sequencing. 
140 μL bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples (WH01 to 
WH04) were reserved for RNA extraction using the 
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (52904; Qiagen, Heiden, 
Germany), according to the manufacturer’s recom­
mendations. A probe-captured technique was used to 
remove human nucleic acid. The remaining RNA was

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The causal agent of an outbreak of severe pneumonia in 
Wuhan, China, is a novel coronavirus, provisionally named 
2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The first cases were 
reported in December, 2019.
Added value of this study
We have described the genomic characteristics of 2019-nCoV 
and similarities and differences to other coronaviruses, 
including the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome epidemic of 2002–03. Genome sequences of 
2019-nCoV sampled from nine patients who were among the 
early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically 
identical, which suggests very recent emergence of this virus in 
humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly. 
2019-nCoV is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses 
of bat origin, indicating that these animals are the likely 
reservoir hosts for this emerging viral pathogen.
Implications of all the available evidence
By documenting the presence of 2019-nCoV in a sample of 
patients, our study extends previous evidence that this virus 
has led to the novel pneumonia that has caused severe disease 
in Wuhan and other geographical localities. Currently available 
data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population 
from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently 
unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host 
between bats and humans.

reverse-transcribed into cDNA, followed by the second-
strand synthesis. Using the synthetic double-stranded 
DNA, a DNA library was constructed through DNA-
fragmentation, end-repair, adaptor-ligation, and PCR 
amplification. The constructed library was qualified with 
an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher, 
Foster City, CA, USA), and the qualified double-stranded 
DNA library was transformed into a single-stranded 
circular DNA library through DNA-denaturation and circu­
larisation. DNA nanoballs were generated from single-
stranded circular DNA by rolling circle amplification, 
then qualified with Qubit 2.0 and loaded onto the flow cell 
and sequenced with PE100 on the DNBSEQ-T7 platform 
(MGI, Shenzhen, China).
After removing adapter, low-quality, and low-complexity 
reads, high-quality genome sequencing data were 
generated. Sequence reads were first filtered against the 
human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler 
Alignment.15 The remaining data were then aligned to 
the local nucleotide database (using Burrows-Wheeler 
Alignment) and non-redundant protein database (using 
RapSearch),16 downloaded from the US National Center 
for Biotechnology Information website, which contain 
only coronaviruses that have been published. Finally, the 
mapped reads were assembled with SPAdes17 to obtain a 
high-quality coronavirus genome sequence.
Primers were designed with use of OLIGO Primer 
Analysis Software version 6.44 on the basis of the assem­
bled partial genome, and were verified by Primer-Blast 
(for more details on primer sequencs used please 
contact the corresponding author). PCR was set up as 
follows: 4·5 μL of 10X buffer, 4 μL of dNTP mix 
(2·5 μmol/L), 1 μL of each primer (10 μmol/L), and 
0·75 units of HS Ex Taq (Takara Biomedical Technology, 
Beijing, China), in a total volume of 30 μL. The cDNAs 
reverse transcribed from clinical samples were used 
as templates, and random primers were used. 
The following program was run on the thermocycler: 
95°C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 
and 72°C for 1 min as determined by product size; 72°C 
for 7 min; and a 4°C hold. Finally, the PCR products 
were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and pro­
ducts of the expected size were sequenced from both 
ends on the Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer 
platform (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster 
City, CA, USA; for more details on expected size please 
contact the corresponding author).
Chinese CDC sequencing strategy
The whole-genome sequences of 2019-nCoV from 
six samples (WH19001, WH19005, WH19002, WH19004, 
WH19008, and YS8011) were generated by a combination 
Sanger, Illumina, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. 
First, viral RNAs were extracted directly from clinical 
samples with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and then 
used to synthesise cDNA with the SuperScript III Reverse 
Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and 
N6 random primers, followed by second-strand syn­
thesis with DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment 
(ThermoFisher). Viral cDNA libraries were prepared 
with use of the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, 
San Diego, CA, USA), then purified with Agencourt 
AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), 
followed by quantification with an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 
Fluorometer. The resulting DNA libraries were sequenced 
on either the MiSeq or iSeq platforms (Illumina) using a 
300-cycle reagent kit. About 1·2–5 GB of data were 
obtained for each sample.
The raw fastQ files for each virus sample were filtered 
using previously described criteria,18 then subjected to 
de  novo assembly with the CLCBio software version 
11.0.1. Mapped assemblies were also done using the bat-
derived SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 
(accession number MG772933.1) as a reference. Variant 
calling, genome alignments, and sequence illustra­
tions were generated with CLCBio software, and the

assembled genome sequences were confirmed by Sanger 
sequencing.
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was done 
to obtain the sequences of the 5ʹ and 3ʹ termini, using the 
Invitrogen 5ʹ RACE System and 3ʹ RACE System 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manu­
facturer’s instructions. Gene-specific primers (appendix 
p 1) for 5ʹ and 3ʹ RACE PCR amplification were designed 
to obtain a fragment of approximately 400–500 bp for the 
two regions. Purified PCR products were cloned into the 
pMD18-T Simple Vector (TaKaRa, Takara Biotechnology, 
Dalian, China) and chemically com­petent Escherichia coli 
(DH5α cells; TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. PCR products were sequenced with use of 
M13 forward and reverse primers.
Virus genome analysis and annotation
Reference virus genomes were obtained from GenBank 
using Blastn with 2019-nCoV as a query. The open 
reading frames of the verified genome sequences were 
predicted using Geneious (version 11.1.5) and anno­
tated using the Conserved Domain Database.19 Pairwise 
sequence identities were also calculated using Geneious. 
Potential genetic recombination was investigated using 
SimPlot software (version 3.5.1)20 and phylogenetic 
analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV with reference se­
quences was done with Mafft software (version 7.450).21 
Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome and 
major coding regions were done with RAxML software 
(version 8.2.9)22 with 1000 bootstrap replicates, employing 
the general time reversible nucleotide substitution model.
Development of molecular diagnostics for 2019-nCoV
On the basis of the genome sequences obtained, a real-time 
PCR detection assay was developed. PCR primers and 
probes were designed using Applied Biosystems Primer 
Express Software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, 
USA) on the basis of our sequenced virus genomes. The 
specific primers and probe set (labelled with the reporter 
6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM] and the quencher Black Hole 
Quencher 1 [BHQ1]) for orf1a were as follows: for­ward primer 
5ʹ-AGAAGATTGGTTAGATGATGATAGT-3ʹ; re­verse pri­mer 
5ʹ-TTCCATCTCTAATTGAGGTTGAACC-3ʹ; 
and 
probe 
5ʹ-FAM-TCCTCACTGCCGTCTTGTTG­ACCA-BHQ1-3ʹ. 
The human GAPDH gene was used as an internal con­trol 
(forward primer 5ʹ-TCAAGAA­GGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3ʹ; 
reverse 
primer 
5ʹ-CAGCGTC­AAA­GGTG­GAGGAGT-3ʹ; 
probe 
5ʹ-VIC-­CCT­CAA­GGG­CATCC­TGGG­CTACACT-
BHQ1-3ʹ). Primers and probes were synthesised by BGI 
(Beijing, China). RT-PCR was done with an Applied 
Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo­
Scientific), with 30 µL reaction volumes consisting of 14 µL 
of diluted RNA, 15 µL of 2X Taqman One-Step RT-PCR 
Master Mix Reagents (4309169; Applied Biosystems, 
ThermoFisher), 0·5 µL of 40X MultiScribe and RNase 
inhibitor mixture, 0·75 μL forward primer (10 μmol/L), 
0·75 μL reverse primer (10 μmol/L), and 0·375 μL probe 
(10 μmol/L). Thermal cycling parameters were 30 min 
at 42°C, followed by 10 min at 95°C, and a subsequent 
40 cycles of amplification (95°C for 15 s and 58°C for 45 s). 
Fluorescence was recorded during the 58°C phase.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in data collection, 
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of report. 
GFG and WS had access to all the data in the study, and 
GFG, WS, WT, WC, and GW were responsible for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
From the nine patients’ samples analysed, eight complete 
and two partial genome sequences of 2019-nCoV were 
obtained. These data have been deposited in the China 
National Microbiological Data Center (accession num­
ber NMDC10013002 and genome accession numbers 
NMDC60013002-01 to NMDC60013002-10) and the data 
from BGI have been deposited in the China National 
GeneBank (acces­sion numbers CNA0007332–35).
Based on these genomes, we developed a real-time 
PCR assay and tested the original clinical samples from 
the BGI (WH01, WH02, WH03, and WH04) again to 
determine their threshold cycle (Ct) values (table). The 
remaining samples were tested by a different real-time 
PCR assay developed by the Chinese CDC, with Ct values 
ranging from 22·85 to 32·41 (table). These results 
confirmed the presence of 2019-nCoV in the patients.
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or cultured 
viruses of nine patients were used for next-generation 
sequencing. After removing host (human) reads, de novo 
assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as 
queries to search the non-redundant protein database. 
Some contigs identified in all the samples were 
closely related to the bat SARS-like betacoronavirus 
bat-SL-CoVZC45 
betacoronavirus.23 
Bat-SL-CoVZC45 
was then used as the reference genome and reads from 
each pool were mapped to it, generating consensus 
sequences corresponding to all the pools. These 
consensus sequences were then used as new reference 
genomes. Eight complete genomes and two partial 
genomes (from samples WH19002 and WH02; table) 
were obtained. The de novo assembly of the clean reads 
from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs 
that corresponded to other viruses at high abundance.
The eight complete genomes were nearly identical 
across the whole genome, with sequence identity above 
99·98%, indicative of a very recent emergence into the 
human population (figure 1A). The largest nucleotide 
difference was four mutations. Notably, the sequence 
identity between the two virus genomes from the same 
patient (WH19001, from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 
and WH19005, from cell culture) was more than 99·99%,

with 100% identity at the amino acid level. In addition, 
the partial genomes from samples WH02 and WH19002 
also had nearly 100% identity to the complete genomes 
across the aligned gene regions.
A Blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-nCoV 
revealed that the most closely related viruses available 
on GenBank were bat-SL-CoVZC45 (sequence identity 
87·99%; query coverage 99%) and another SARS-like 
betacoronavirus of bat origin, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (acces­
sion number MG772934;23 87·23%; query coverage 98%). 
In five gene regions (E, M, 7, N, and 14), the sequence 
identities were greater than 90%, with the highest 
being 98·7% in the E gene (figure 2A). The S gene of 
2019-nCoV exhibited the lowest sequence identity with 
bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, at only around 
75%. In addition, the sequence identity in 1b (about 86%) 
was lower than that in 1a (about 90%; figure 2A). Most of 
the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity 
between 2019-nCoV and the related bat-derived corona­
viruses (figure 2a). The notable exception was the spike 
protein, with only around 80% sequence identity, and 
protein 13, with 73·2% sequence identity. Notably, the 
2019-nCoV strains were less genetically similar to 
SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). The 
similarity between 2019-nCoV and related viruses was 
visualised using SimPlot software, with the 2019-nCoV 
consensus sequence employed as the query (figure 2B).
Comparison of the predicted coding regions of 
2019-nCoV showed that they possessed a similar genomic 
organisation to bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and 
SARS-CoV (figure 1B). At least 12 coding regions were 
predicted, including 1ab, S, 3, E, M, 7, 8, 9, 10b, N, 13, and 
14 (figure 1B). The lengths of most of the proteins encoded 
by 2019-nCoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 
were similar, with only a few minor insertions or dele­
tions. A notable difference was a longer spike protein 
encoded by 2019-nCoV compared with the bat SARS-like 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (figure 1B).
Phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV and its closely 
related reference genomes, as well as representative beta­
coronaviruses, revealed that the five subgenera formed 
five well supported branches (figure 3). The subgenus

Sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported 
clades: two SARS-CoV-related strains from Rhinolophus sp 
from Bulgaria (accession number GU190215) and Kenya 
(KY352407) formed clade 1; the ten 2019-nCoV from 
Wuhan and the two bat-derived SARS-like strains from 
Zhoushan in eastern China (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and 
bat-SL-CoVZXC21) formed clade 2, which was notable for 
the long branch separating the human and bat viruses; 
and SARS-CoV strains from humans and many genetically 
similar SARS-like corona­viruses from bats collected 
from southwestern China formed clade 3, with bat-derived 
coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions (figure 3). 
In addition, 2019-nCoV was distinct from SARS-CoV 
in a phylogeny of the complete RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (RdRp) gene (appendix p 2). This evidence 
indicates that 2019-nCoV is a novel beta­coronavirus 
from the subgenus Sarbecovirus.
As the sequence similarity plot revealed changes in 
genetic distances among viruses across the 2019-nCoV 
genome, we did additional phylogenetic analyses of 
the major encoding regions of representative members 
of the subgenus Sarbecovirus. Consistent with the 
genome phylogeny, 2019-nCoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and 
bat-SL-CoVZXC21 clustered together in trees of 
the 1a and spike genes (appendix p 3). By contrast, 
2019-nCoV did not cluster with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and 
bat-SL-CoVZXC21 in the 1b tree, but instead formed a 
distinct clade with SARS-CoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and 
bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (appendix p 3), indicative of potential 
recombination events in 1b, although these probably 
occurred in the bat coronaviruses rather than 2019-nCoV. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome ex­
cluding 1b revealed similar evolutionary relationships as 
the full-length viral genome (appendix p 3).
The envelope spike (S) protein mediates receptor 
binding and membrane fusion24 and is crucial for 
determining host tropism and transmission capacity.25,26 
Generally, the spike protein of coronaviruses is func­
tionally divided into the S1 domain (especially positions 
318–510 of SARS-CoV), responsible for receptor binding,

and the S2 domain, responsible for cell membrane 
fusion.27 The 2019-nCoV S2 protein showed around 
93% sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and 
bat-SL-CoVZXC21—much higher than that of the 
S1 domain, which had only around 68% identity with 
these bat-derived viruses. Both the N-terminal domain 
and the C-terminal domain of the S1 domain can bind to 
host receptors.28 We inspected amino acid variation in the 
spike protein among the Sarbecovirus coronaviruses 
(figure 4). Although 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV fell 
within different clades (figure 3), they still possessed 
around 50 conserved amino acids in S1, whereas most 
of the bat-derived viruses displayed mutational differences 
(figure 4). Most of these positions in the C-terminal 
domain (figure 4). In addition, a number of deletion 
events, including positions 455–457, 463–464, and 485–497, 
were found in the bat-derived strains (figure 4).
The receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses, 
which directly engages the receptor, is commonly 
located in the C-terminal domain of S1, as in SARS-CoV29 
for lineage B, and MERS-CoV30,31 and BatCoV HKU4,32 
for lineage C (figure 5). Through phylogenetic analysis 
of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages 
of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, 
although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 
and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the 
receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within 
lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). 
The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptor-
binding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model 
program33 with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain 
structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8)34 as a template. 
This analysis suggested that, like other betacoro­
naviruses, the receptor-binding domain was composed 
of a core and an external subdomain (figure 5B–D). 
Notably, the external subdomain of the 2019-nCoV 
receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of 
SARS-CoV. This result suggests that 2019-nCoV might 
also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a 
cell receptor. However, we also observed that several key 
residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV 
receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were 
variable in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain 
(including Asn439, Asn501, Gln493, Gly485 and Phe486; 
2019-nCoV numbering).
Discussion
From genomic surveillance of clinical samples from 
patients with viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, a novel 
coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV) has been identified.10,11 
Our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV, sequenced from 
nine patients’ samples, showed that the virus belongs to 
the subgenus Sarbecovirus. 2019-nCoV was more similar 
to two bat-derived coronavirus strains, bat-SL-CoVZC45 
and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, than to known human-infecting 
coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the SARS 
outbreak of 2003.
Epidemiologically, eight of the nine patients in our study 
had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market 
in Wuhan, suggesting that they might have been in close 
contact with the infection source at the market. However, 
one patient had never visited the market, although he 
had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of 
their illness. This finding suggests either possible droplet 
transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently 
unknown source. Evidence of clusters of infected family 
members and medical workers has now confirmed the 
presence of human-to-human transmission.12 Clearly, 
this infection is a major public health concern, particularly 
as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the Chinese

Spring Festival travel rush, during which hundreds of 
millions of people will travel through China.
As a typical RNA virus, the average evolutionary rate 
for coronaviruses is roughly 10–⁴ nucleotide substitutions 
per site per year,1 with mutations arising during 
every replication cycle. It is, therefore, striking that 
the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients 
described here were almost identical, with greater than 
99·9% sequence identity. This finding suggests that 
2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very 
short period and was detected relatively rapidly. 
However, as the virus transmits to more individuals, 
constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived corona­
viruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus 
Betacoronavirus. Moreover, bat-derived coronaviruses fell 
in basal positions in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, with 
2019-nCoV most closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 
and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were also sampled from 
bats.23 These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for 
coronaviruses in general and for 2019-nCoV in particular. 
However, despite the importance of bats, several facts 
suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate 
host between bats and humans. First, the outbreak was 
first reported in late December, 2019, when most bat 
species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were 
sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas 
various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were 
available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity 
between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 
and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is 
reflected in the relatively long branch between them. 
Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not 
direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS-CoV 
and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, 
with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV35 
and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV)36 acting as an 
intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. 
Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely 
that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might 
also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been 
transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild 
animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.
Previous studies have uncovered several receptors 
that different coronaviruses bind to, such as ACE2 for 
SARS-CoV29 and CD26 for MERS-CoV.30 Our molecular 
modelling showed structural similarity between the 
receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. 
Therefore, we suggest that 2019-nCoV might use ACE2 as 
the receptor, despite the presence of amino acid mutations 
in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain. Although a 
previous study using HeLa cells expressing ACE2 
proteins showed that 2019-nCoV could employ the ACE2 
receptor,37 whether these mutations affect ACE2 binding 
or change receptor tropism requires further study.
Recombination has been seen frequently in coro­
naviruses.1 As expected, we detected recombination in 
the Sarbecoviruses analysed here. Our results suggest 
that recombination events are complex and are more 
likely occurring in bat coronaviruses than in 2019-nCoV. 
Hence, despite its occurrence, recombination is probably 
not the reason for emergence of this virus, although this 
inference might change if more closely related animal 
viruses are identified.
In conclusion, we have described the genomic structure 
of a seventh human coronavirus that can cause severe 
pneumonia and have shed light on its origin and

outbreak linked to 2019-nCoV again highlights the hid­

occasionally spill over into human populations.
