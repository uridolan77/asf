# Screening Router Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to the `screening.py` file in the API routers directory.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Syntax Errors**
   - Fixed the module docstring by enclosing it in triple quotes
   - Fixed class docstrings by enclosing them in triple quotes
   - Removed unused import of `ScreeningService`

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Added comprehensive docstrings for all endpoint functions
   - Enhanced class docstrings with more detailed descriptions
   - Used Google-style docstring format

3. **Code Modernization**
   - Updated deprecated `dict()` method to `model_dump()` for Pydantic models

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Module Docstring

Added proper triple quotes to the module docstring:

```python
"""Screening router for the Medical Research Synthesizer API.

This module provides endpoints for PRISMA-guided screening and bias assessment.
"""
```

### 2. Fixed Class Docstrings

Added proper triple quotes to class docstrings and enhanced descriptions:

```python
class ScreeningCriteriaItem(BaseModel):
    """Screening criteria item.
    
    This model represents a single screening criterion item with text and optional description.
    """
    text: str = Field(..., description="Criterion text")
    description: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Criterion description")
```

```python
class ScreeningCriteria(BaseModel):
    """Screening criteria.
    
    This model represents a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria for screening.
    """
    include: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Inclusion criteria")
    exclude: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Exclusion criteria")
```

```python
class ScreeningRequest(BaseModel):
    """PRISMA screening request.
    
    This model represents a request for PRISMA-guided screening of articles.
    """
    query: str = Field(..., description="Search query")
    max_results: int = Field(20, description="Maximum number of results to screen")
    stage: ScreeningStage = Field(ScreeningStage.SCREENING, description="Screening stage")
    criteria: Optional[ScreeningCriteria] = Field(None, description="Custom screening criteria")
```

```python
class BiasAssessmentRequest(BaseModel):
    """Bias assessment request.
    
    This model represents a request for bias assessment of articles.
    """
    query: str = Field(..., description="Search query")
    max_results: int = Field(20, description="Maximum number of results to assess")
    domains: Optional[List[BiasDomain]] = Field(None, description="Bias domains to assess")
```

### 3. Added Endpoint Function Docstrings

Added comprehensive docstrings for all endpoint functions:

```python
@router.post("/prisma", response_model=APIResponse[Dict[str, Any]])
@async_timed("screen_articles_endpoint")
async def screen_articles(
    request: ScreeningRequest,
    search_service: SearchService = Depends(get_search_service),
    screening_service: PRISMAScreeningService = Depends(get_prisma_screening_service),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    """Screen articles using PRISMA guidelines.
    
    This endpoint screens articles based on PRISMA guidelines. It first searches for articles
    using the provided query, then applies screening criteria to determine which articles
    should be included or excluded.
    
    Args:
        request: The screening request containing query and criteria
        search_service: Service for searching articles
        screening_service: Service for screening articles
        current_user: The authenticated user making the request
        
    Returns:
        APIResponse containing screening results
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If an error occurs during screening
    """
```

```python
@router.post("/bias-assessment", response_model=APIResponse[Dict[str, Any]])
@async_timed("assess_bias_endpoint")
async def assess_bias(
    request: BiasAssessmentRequest,
    search_service: SearchService = Depends(get_search_service),
    bias_service: BiasAssessmentService = Depends(get_bias_assessment_service),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    """Assess bias in articles.
    
    This endpoint assesses bias in articles based on various domains. It first searches for articles
    using the provided query, then applies bias assessment to determine the risk level for each article.
    
    Args:
        request: The bias assessment request containing query and domains
        search_service: Service for searching articles
        bias_service: Service for assessing bias
        current_user: The authenticated user making the request
        
    Returns:
        APIResponse containing bias assessment results
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If an error occurs during bias assessment
    """
```

```python
@router.get("/flow-diagram", response_model=APIResponse[Dict[str, Any]])
@async_timed("get_flow_diagram_endpoint")
async def get_flow_diagram(
    screening_service: PRISMAScreeningService = Depends(get_prisma_screening_service),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    """Get PRISMA flow diagram data.
    
    This endpoint retrieves data for generating a PRISMA flow diagram, which shows the flow of
    articles through the screening process.
    
    Args:
        screening_service: Service for screening articles
        current_user: The authenticated user making the request
        
    Returns:
        APIResponse containing flow diagram data
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If an error occurs while retrieving flow diagram data
    """
```

### 4. Updated Deprecated Method

Updated the deprecated `dict()` method to `model_dump()` for Pydantic models:

```python
"criteria": request.criteria.model_dump() if request.criteria else None
```

## Verification

The fixes were verified using:

1. The docstring checker script, which confirmed no missing or incomplete docstrings
2. Visual inspection of the file structure and syntax

These changes have significantly improved the quality and maintainability of the screening.py file, making it easier to understand and extend in the future.
