# Messaging Tasks Router Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to the `messaging_tasks.py` file in the API routers directory.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Module Docstring**
   - Added proper triple-quoted module docstring
   - Included description of the module's purpose

2. **Missing Class Definitions**
   - Added proper class definitions for request and response models:
     - `SearchTaskRequest`: Model for analysis task requests
     - `ExportTaskRequest`: Model for export task requests
     - `TaskResponse`: Model for task operation responses
   - Added proper field definitions with descriptions

3. **Code Structure Issues**
   - Fixed code that was incorrectly placed at the module level
   - Added missing function definition for `publish_analysis_task`
   - Properly structured the endpoint functions

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Added comprehensive docstrings for all classes and functions
   - Used Google-style docstring format
   - Included Args, Returns, and Raises sections
   - Added detailed descriptions of function behavior

## Changes Made

### 1. Module Docstring

Added a proper module docstring:

```python
"""API endpoints for messaging tasks.

This module provides API endpoints for publishing tasks to the message broker,
including analysis tasks and export tasks.
"""
```

### 2. Class Definitions

Added proper class definitions with fields and docstrings:

```python
class SearchTaskRequest(BaseModel):
    """Request model for search tasks."""
    analysis_type: str = Field(..., description="Type of analysis to perform (contradictions, bias, trends)")
    study_ids: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="List of study IDs for contradiction analysis")
    study_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Study ID for bias analysis")
    topic: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Topic for trend analysis")
    time_range: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Time range for analysis")


class ExportTaskRequest(BaseModel):
    """Request model for export tasks."""
    export_type: str = Field(..., description="Type of export (results, analysis)")
    format: str = Field(..., description="Export format (json, csv, excel, pdf)")
    result_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Result ID for results export")
    analysis_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Analysis ID for analysis export")


class TaskResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response model for task operations."""
    task_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique task identifier")
    task_type: TaskType = Field(..., description="Type of task")
    status: str = Field(..., description="Task status")
    message: str = Field(..., description="Task message")
```

### 3. Function Definitions

Added proper function definitions with docstrings:

```python
@router.post("/analysis", response_model=TaskResponse)
async def publish_analysis_task(
    request: SearchTaskRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Publish an analysis task to the message broker.
    
    This endpoint publishes an analysis task to the message broker for asynchronous
    processing. The task type is determined based on the analysis_type field in the request.
    
    Args:
        request: Analysis task request containing the analysis type and parameters
        current_user: The authenticated user making the request
        
    Returns:
        TaskResponse containing the task ID and status
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If RabbitMQ is disabled or if the request is invalid
    """
    # Function implementation...
```

### 4. Documentation Improvements

Updated docstrings for all functions to follow Google-style format:

```python
@router.get("/task/{task_id}", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
async def get_task_status(
    task_id: str,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Get the status of a task.
    
    This endpoint retrieves the current status of a task by its ID.
    
    Args:
        task_id: The unique identifier of the task
        current_user: The authenticated user making the request
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing the task status information
    """
    # Function implementation...
```

## Verification

The fixes were verified using:

1. The docstring checker script, which confirmed no missing or incomplete docstrings
2. Visual inspection of the file structure and syntax

These changes have significantly improved the quality and maintainability of the messaging_tasks.py file, making it easier to understand and extend in the future.
