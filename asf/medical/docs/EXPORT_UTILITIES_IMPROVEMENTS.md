# Export Utilities Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the export utilities in the Medical Research Synthesizer.

## 1. Common Export Utilities

Created a common export utilities module (`export_utils_common.py`) that provides:

- Data validation functions
- Data cleaning functions
- Field filtering functions
- Metadata generation functions
- Common field lists
- Standardized error handling

## 2. Refactored Export Functions

Updated all export functions in `export_utils_consolidated.py` to use the common utilities:

- JSON export
- CSV export
- Excel export
- PDF export
- Contradiction analysis PDF export

## 3. Standardized Error Handling

Implemented consistent error handling in export utilities:

- Added proper exception types (ValidationError)
- Added appropriate logging for all exceptions
- Used consistent error message formatting
- Added proper exception chaining with `from e`

## 4. Added Tests

Created tests for the export utilities:

- Unit tests for each export function
- Tests for both valid and invalid data
- Standalone test script for quick verification

## 5. Added Missing Exception Class

Added the ExportError class to the core exceptions module:

- Proper inheritance from base exception class
- Appropriate attributes for export-specific information
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Updated module docstring to include the new class

## Benefits

These improvements provide several benefits:

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common functionality is now in a single place
2. **Consistent Behavior**: All export functions handle data and errors consistently
3. **Better Error Reporting**: Errors are properly logged and include detailed information
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to common functionality only need to be made in one place
5. **Better Testing**: Comprehensive tests ensure the export utilities work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Update Export Service**: Refactor the export service to use the common utilities
2. **Add More Tests**: Add integration tests for the export API endpoints
3. **Improve Performance**: Optimize export operations for large datasets
4. **Add More Export Formats**: Consider adding support for additional formats (e.g., XML, BIBTEX)
5. **Enhance Documentation**: Add more examples and usage documentation
