# Enhanced Medical Research Synthesizer

This document outlines the strategic enhancements implemented in the Medical Research Synthesizer pipeline. The primary objective is to improve the system's robustness, contextual understanding, knowledge extraction accuracy, and factual consistency, particularly when processing complex biomedical literature.

## Overview of Enhancements

The enhancement strategy encompasses several key areas:

1. **PDF Parsing**: Improved text extraction from complex layouts by integrating PDFMiner.six alongside PyMuPDF.
2. **Section Classification**: Implemented automated identification of IMRAD sections using fine-tuned SciBERT.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Adopted GLiNER-biomed for improved handling of complex biomedical entities.
4. **Relation Extraction**: Replaced GATv2Conv GNN with HGTConv for better modeling of heterogeneous document graphs.
5. **Summarization Strategy**: Refined the input to SciFive-Large by prioritizing key document sections.
6. **Factual Consistency**: Integrated automated checks (QAFactEval/SummaC) into the summarization pipeline.
7. **Component Integration**: Ensured seamless data flow and interoperability between upgraded components.
8. **Code Organization**: Divided the monolithic implementation into focused modules with clear responsibilities.

## Key Enhancements in Detail

### 1. Improved PDF Parsing Robustness

The enhanced PDF parser integrates PDFMiner.six alongside PyMuPDF to handle complex scientific layouts more effectively. The system can automatically select the appropriate parser based on document characteristics or use both and choose the better result.

```python
# Example usage
from asf.medical.ml.document_processing import MedicalResearchSynthesizer

# Initialize with PDF parser preferences
synthesizer = MedicalResearchSynthesizer(
    document_processor_args={
        "prefer_pdfminer": True  # Prefer PDFMiner.six over PyMuPDF
    }
)
```

### 2. Automated Section Classification

The enhanced section classifier uses a fine-tuned SciBERT model to identify standard IMRAD sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) in scientific documents. This enables more accurate section identification and better input selection for summarization.

```python
# Example usage
from asf.medical.ml.document_processing import MedicalResearchSynthesizer

# Initialize with section classifier preferences
synthesizer = MedicalResearchSynthesizer(
    document_processor_args={
        "use_enhanced_section_classifier": True
    }
)
```

### 3. Improved Biomedical Named Entity Recognition

The enhanced entity extractor uses GLiNER-biomed, a generalist and lightweight model for biomedical named entity recognition that can handle overlapping and complex entities through a span-based approach. This improves the accuracy of entity extraction, especially for complex biomedical entities.

```python
# Example usage
from asf.medical.ml.document_processing import MedicalResearchSynthesizer

# Initialize with entity extractor preferences
synthesizer = MedicalResearchSynthesizer(
    entity_extractor_args={
        "use_gliner": True,
        "confidence_threshold": 0.6
    }
)
```

### 4. Advanced Relation Extraction with HGTConv

The enhanced relation extractor uses a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) model, which is specifically designed for heterogeneous graphs with different node and edge types. This improves the accuracy of relation extraction, especially for complex document-level relations.

```python
# Example usage
from asf.medical.ml.document_processing import MedicalResearchSynthesizer

# Initialize with relation extractor preferences
synthesizer = MedicalResearchSynthesizer(
    relation_extractor_args={
        "use_hgt": True,
        "encoder_model": "microsoft/biogpt"
    }
)
```

### 5. Optimized Summarization Strategy

The enhanced summarizer refines the input to SciFive-Large by prioritizing key document sections (Abstract, Results, and Conclusion). This improves the quality of summaries by focusing on the most important information in the document.

```python
# Example usage
from asf.medical.ml.document_processing import MedicalResearchSynthesizer

# Initialize with summarizer preferences
synthesizer = MedicalResearchSynthesizer(
    summarizer_args={
        "use_enhanced": True,
        "max_length": 512
    }
)
```

### 6. Factual Consistency Checking

The enhanced summarizer integrates automated checks for factual consistency using QAFactEval or SummaC. This ensures that the generated summaries are factually consistent with the source document.

```python
# Example usage
from asf.medical.ml.document_processing import MedicalResearchSynthesizer

# Initialize with factual consistency checking
synthesizer = MedicalResearchSynthesizer(
    summarizer_args={
        "use_enhanced": True,
        "check_factual_consistency": True,
        "consistency_method": "qafacteval",
        "consistency_threshold": 0.6
    }
)
```

## Complete Usage Example

# Process batch with 2 papers in parallel
batch_metrics = synthesizer.process_batch(
    file_list=papers,
    output_dir="batch_output",
    batch_size=2,
    all_pdfs=True
)

# Print batch metrics
print(f"Total processing time: {batch_metrics['total_processing_time']:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Average document time: {batch_metrics['avg_document_time']:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Total entities extracted: {batch_metrics['entities_total']}")
```

### 3. Advanced Caching

labeled_data = {
    "entities": [
        {"text": "COVID-19", "label": "DISEASE", "start": 50, "end": 58,
         "context": "This study evaluates the efficacy of a novel antiviral treatment for COVID-19."}
    ],
    "relations": [
        {"head": "novel antiviral", "tail": "COVID-19", "relation": "TREATS",
         "context": "This study evaluates the efficacy of a novel antiviral treatment for COVID-19."}
    ]
}

# Update models with labeled data
update_metrics = synthesizer.update_models(
    labeled_data=labeled_data,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    batch_size=2,
    epochs=3
)

# Print update metrics
print(f"Entity extractor update: {update_metrics.get('entity_extractor', {})}")
```

## Future Work

Beyond the scope of this immediate enhancement plan, several avenues warrant future exploration:

1. **Learning-Based PDF Parsing**: Investigate integrating or replacing the PDF parsing module with learning-based approaches like Nougat for potentially higher accuracy, especially with mathematical content and complex layouts.

2. **Discontinuous NER**: Explicitly evaluate and potentially refine GLiNER-biomed's capability for handling discontinuous entities, or explore integrating specialized techniques if needed.

3. **Advanced Multi-Task Learning**: Explore more sophisticated multi-task learning frameworks, potentially training the encoder jointly on NER, RE, and section classification tasks to improve shared representations.

4. **Continuous Monitoring and Updates**: Establish a process for continuously monitoring new model releases, techniques, and benchmarks relevant to biomedical text processing and plan for periodic updates to the pipeline components.

5. **Distributed Processing**: Extend the parallel and batch processing capabilities to support distributed processing across multiple machines for handling very large document collections.
