# ASF Medical Research Synthesizer Consolidation

This document describes the consolidation process for the ASF Medical Research Synthesizer codebase.

## Overview

The consolidation process involved:

1. Unifying the authentication system
2. Standardizing the API layer
3. Creating consistent interfaces
4. Updating client code
5. Adding comprehensive tests
6. Cleaning up old code

## Unified Authentication

The authentication system was consolidated into a single, comprehensive implementation:

- **auth.py**: A service-based authentication module with JWT token handling, role-based access control, and proper password hashing
- **routers/auth.py**: A unified authentication router with endpoints for login, registration, and user management

## Standardized API Layer

The API layer was standardized to use a single, comprehensive FastAPI application:

- **main.py**: A unified FastAPI application with modern lifespan management, middleware, and documentation
- **dependencies.py**: Updated dependencies to use the unified authentication system

## Consistent Interfaces

Consistent interfaces were created for API requests and responses:

- **models/base.py**: Base models for consistent API responses with success/error handling and metadata
- **Updated Routers**: All routers were updated to use the consistent interfaces:
  - **search.py**: Unified search router
  - **enhanced_contradiction.py**: Enhanced contradiction router
  - **contradiction_resolution.py**: Contradiction resolution router
  - **screening.py**: Unified screening router
  - **export.py**: Unified export router
  - **analysis.py**: Unified analysis router
  - **knowledge_base.py**: Unified knowledge base router

## Client Library

A comprehensive client library was created for interacting with the unified API:

- **client/api_client.py**: A client library with methods for all API endpoints
- **client/examples/**: Example scripts demonstrating how to use the client library

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were added for the unified authentication and API:

- **tests/unit/test_auth.py**: Unit tests for the authentication service and dependencies
- **tests/integration/test_api.py**: Integration tests for the API endpoints

## Cleanup

The old code was cleaned up to remove redundant implementations:

- Old router files were removed
- Old authentication implementations were removed
- Old main files were removed
- Imports were updated to use the new file names

## File Structure

The consolidated file structure is as follows:

```bash

```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest asf/medical/tests
```

To run specific tests:

```bash
pytest asf/medical/tests/unit
pytest asf/medical/tests/integration
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
pytest asf/medical/tests --cov=asf.medical
```

## Using the Client Library

To use the client library:

```python
import asyncio
from asf.medical.client.api_client import MedicalResearchSynthesizerClient

async def main():
    client = MedicalResearchSynthesizerClient()

    try:
        # Login
        login_response = await client.login("user@example.com", "password")

        # Search
        search_response = await client.search("statin therapy cardiovascular")

        # Process results
        results = search_response.data["results"]
        print(f"Found {len(results)} results")

    finally:
        # Close client
        await client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

For more examples, see the `client/examples/` directory.

## Benefits of Consolidation

The consolidation provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Single, consistent codebase that's easier to understand and maintain
2. **Enhanced Security**: Unified authentication with proper JWT handling, password hashing, and role-based access control
3. **Better Developer Experience**: Consistent interfaces and error handling make it easier to work with the API
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests ensure the code works as expected
5. **Modern Architecture**: Modern FastAPI features like lifespan management, dependency injection, and middleware
6. **Client Library**: A comprehensive client library makes it easy to interact with the API
