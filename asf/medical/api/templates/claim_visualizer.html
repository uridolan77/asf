            covid: `Background: Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
Methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial evaluated remdesivir in adult patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily for 9 days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28.
Results: 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the remdesivir group (n=158) or the placebo group (n=79). Time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between groups (hazard ratio 1.23, 95% CI 0.87-1.75). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 patients in the remdesivir group and 50 (64%) of 78 in the placebo control group.
Conclusion: Our trial found that remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits in adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19. However, we could not exclude clinically meaningful differences and larger studies are needed to confirm our findings.`,
            
            diabetes: `Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may reduce the risk of kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, but evidence has been inconsistent.
Methods: In this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of a sustained decline in the estimated GFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes.
Results: The trial was stopped early because of efficacy. At that time, the primary outcome had occurred in 197 of 2152 participants (9.2%) in the dapagliflozin group and 312 of 2152 participants (14.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.72; P<0.001). The hazard ratio for the composite of a sustained decline in the estimated GFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal causes was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.68; P<0.001).
Conclusion: Among patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, the risk of a composite of a sustained decline in the estimated GFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes was significantly lower with dapagliflozin than with placebo.`,
            
            oncology: `Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved outcomes in patients with various cancers, but their efficacy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains controversial.
Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 trial evaluating pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint was overall survival.
Results: A total of 180 patients underwent randomization. Median overall survival was 7.8 months in the pembrolizumab group and 7.4 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.25; P=0.58). Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months in the pembrolizumab group and 3.9 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.18; P=0.42). The objective response rate was 14.3% in the pembrolizumab group and 12.1% in the placebo group.
Conclusion: The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy did not significantly improve overall survival in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. These findings suggest that single-agent immune checkpoint inhibition may not be effective in unselected patients with pancreatic cancer.`
